# Getting Started With Hardware Firewall Dedicated
The Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) provides customers with an essential layer of security that is provisioned on demand without service interruptions. It prevents unwanted traffic from hitting your servers, reducing your attack surface, and allowing your server resources to be dedicated for their intended use.  

To order a Hardware Firewall (Dedicated), perform the following procedure:

1. From your browser, open the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.
3. Scroll to the VLAN you want protected and click on the **Add Firewall** link in the same row. This link opens the **Order Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)** page.
4. Select **Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)** to order one Firewall or **Hardware Firewall (High Availability)** to order two Firewalls in a high availability pair.
5. Enter your choice of payment and click **Continue**.
6. In the next screen, enter promo codes if applicable, read and agree to the Master Service Agreement and click on **Place Order**. 

After the Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) is provisioned, you can [configure it1](/docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-dedicated/editing-rules.html).
