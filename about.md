# About the Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)
{: #about-the-hardware-firewall-dedicated-}

A Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) is a dedicated single-tenant network device that is connected upstream from a server and protects any or all servers on a public VLAN. It is purchased separately from a server, and it can be added to a VLAN at any time.   

With the Hardware Firewall (Dedicated), you have access to advanced features and the ability to fine tune the device to a much higher degree than other products. The firewall blocks or shapes traffic before the traffic ever reaches the server. The main advantages are that a server only has to handle 'good' traffic and that bandwidth can be constrained for less critical communications. 

Customers can manage the firewall through the Customer Portal. High availability can also be ordered, which provides two appliances in active-passive deployment with synchronized configurations.

Since monthly server bandwidth is recorded at the server switch port, traffic blocked by the Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) is not counted against your monthly allotments, eliminating the need to pay for unwanted traffic.
