# Known Limitations for Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)
{: #known-limitations-for-hardware-firewall-dedicated-}

There are some limitations to be aware of when using your Hardware Firewall (Dedicated).
{: shortdesc}

* Incompatible with Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) due to the way ARP is processed

* High Availability failover functionality is not exposed to the user. If the master firewall malfunctions, but does not failover automatically a support case will be required. Device monitoring for critical services is recommended to ensure that firewalls are appropriately passing traffic.

* A Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) cannot be deployed on a VLAN that is currently associated with a Network Gateway, Hardware Firewall, or Fortigate Security Appliance.
