# Bypass the Firewall Rules

To bypass the firewall rules,

1. From your browser, open the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, go to **Network > IP Management > VLANs** and click on the firewall device you want to bypass.
3. In the **Device Details** page,  you can use the **Actions** drop down menu to choose **Set Rule Bypass** or in the **Status:** section, you can click on the **Bypass Rules** button. Bypassing the rules takes approximately two minutes to take effect. The Status should change to "Bypassing All Rules".

	Another option is to route around the firewall. You can use the **Actions** drop down menu to choose **Set Route Bypass** or in the **Status:** section, you can click on the **Route Around** button. Either way, you should get a confirmation dialog. Click **Yes** to confirm the action. Bypassing the route takes approximately two minutes to take effect. While in bypass mode, the "Status" will be "Routing AROUND firewall".

## Enable the Rules Again

To enable the rules again, follow the instructions above to reach the **Configuration** tab of the device and click on the **Actions** dropdown menu and choose **Set Route Bypass**. You will get a confirmation dialog. Click **Yes** to confirm the action. The "Status" will change back to "Routing THROUGH firewall" within two minutes.
