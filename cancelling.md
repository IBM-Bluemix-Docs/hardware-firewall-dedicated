Your Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) can be cancelled at any time, by performing the procedure here.
{: shortdesc}

1. From your browser, open the [IBM Cloud catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com){:new_window} and log in to your account.
2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), then click **Classic Infrastructure**.
3. Select **Network > IP Management > VLANs** and click the firewall device that you want to cancel.
4. From the **Device Details** page, click the **Actions** menu and choose **Cancel Device**. In the confirmation dialog, choose whether you want to cancel immediately or in the next billing cycle. Click **Continue** to cancel the device.

Cancelling the firewall leaves all devices on the VLAN without front-end firewall protection. This service is provided month-to-month and billing is discontinued for the next month upon cancellation.
